{"rule":"MORFOLOGIK_RULE_EN_US","sentence":"^\\QOur analysis is composed of three different studies: 1) a timescale decomposition of disease transmissibility values, thereby guiding officials to understand the climatology and behaviour of outbreaks for budget and resource allocation; 2) a correlation analysis between transmissibility values and different climate variability indices, such as El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, in order to understand the effects of natural climate patterns onto Aedes-borne outbreaks; and 3) a causality analysis to solidify findings obtained through correlation, identifying the most relevant predictors and their applicability in a climate-and-health service framework for forecasting the transmissibility of Aedes-borne diseases.\\E$"}
