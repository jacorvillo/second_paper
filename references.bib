  abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases pose a growing global health threat, with shifting environmental conditions and human activities altering mosquito breeding patterns. This study employs remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify key ecological and anthropogenic factors influencing mosquito breeding hotspots. High-resolution satellite imagery and spatial analysis techniques were utilized to assess land cover changes, water body distribution, temperature variations, and urban expansion. Findings indicate that stagnant water bodies, deforested areas, and poorly managed urban environments significantly contribute to mosquito proliferation. Additionally, climate variability, including rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, has expanded suitable breeding habitats. The integration of remote sensing and GIS enhances the accuracy of mosquito habitat prediction, enabling targeted vector control strategies and public health interventions. These findings emphasize the need for proactive environmental management and urban planning to mitigate mosquito-borne disease risks. Future research should focus on improving predictive models by incorporating real-time climate data and socioeconomic factors to develop adaptive strategies for disease prevention.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Dengue dynamics are driven by complex interactions between hosts, vectors and viruses that are influenced by environmental and climatic factors. El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a multiyear climate driver of local temperature and rainfall worldwide while the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in the Indian Ocean which controls the summer monsoon rainfall in the Indian region. Several studies examined the role of El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in dengue incidence. However, the role of IOD remains unexplored. Here, we examined the effects of ENSO and IOD on dengue incidence in Bangladesh. Methods: Distributed lag nonlinear model and wavelet coherence analysis were performed to estimate the association between the monthly dengue incidence in Bangladesh (January 2000-October 2012), ENSO index (Nino 3.4, a measure of the average sea surface temperature in the Nino 3.4 region) and IOD index (DMI- dipole mode index). Results: Both ENSO and IOD were positively associated with dengue incidence in Bangladesh. A unit increase in ENSO and IOD was associated with an increase of 3.3\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.8, 12.3) and 2.5\% (95\% CI: 0.5, 11.7) in dengue incidence, respectively. There was a strong coherence between ENSO and dengue at a periodicity of 1-2 years, when the coherence between IOD and dengue was observed at a periodicity of 1 year. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that both ENSO and IOD play an important role in dengue transmission and should be taken into account when building predictive models for dengue in Bangladesh. The results of this study may provide an empirical basis for predicting dengue epidemics in Bangladesh and have potential to improve disease control in vulnerable regions.}

Furthermore, we project that from 1991--2020 to 2071--2099, 5\% of the land surface will transition to a different major class under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6 scenario, 8\% under the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 13\% under the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario.

  abstract = {Zika, a mosquito-borne viral disease that emerged in South America in 2015, was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO in February of 2016. We developed a climate-driven R0 mathematical model for the transmission risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) that explicitly includes two key mosquito vector species: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The model was parameterized and calibrated using the most up to date information from the available literature. It was then driven by observed gridded temperature and rainfall datasets for the period 1950--2015. We find that the transmission risk in South America in 2015 was the highest since 1950. This maximum is related to favoring temperature conditions that caused the simulated biting rates to be largest and mosquito mortality rates and extrinsic incubation periods to be smallest in 2015. This event followed the suspected introduction of ZIKV in Brazil in 2013. The ZIKV outbreak in Latin America has very likely been fueled by the 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o climate phenomenon affecting the region. The highest transmission risk globally is in South America and tropical countries where Ae. aegypti is abundant. Transmission risk is strongly seasonal in temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present, with significant risk of ZIKV transmission in the southeastern states of the United States, in southern China, and to a lesser extent, over southern Europe during the boreal summer season.},

All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups.},

The objective techniques include the inverse-distance weighting algorithms of Cressman (1959) and Shepard (1968), and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin (1965). Intercomparisons and cross-validation tests are conducted to examine their performance over various parts of the globe where station network densities are different. The gauge data used in the examinations are quality controlled daily precipitation reports from roughly 16,000 stations over the global land areas that have been collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). Data sources include daily summary files from the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), and the CPC unified daily gauge data sets over the contiguous United States (CONUS), Mexico, and South America. All three objective techniques are capable of generating useful daily precipitation analyses with biases of generally less than 1\% over most parts of the global land areas. The OI method consistently performs the best among the three techniques for almost all situations (regions, seasons, and network densities). The Shepard scheme compares reasonably well with the OI, while the Cressman method tends to generate smooth precipitation fields with wider raining areas relative to the station observations. The quality of the gauge-based analyses degrades as the network of station observations becomes sparser, although the OI technique exhibits relatively stable performance statistics over regions covered by fewer gauges.},

We identify a distinct indicator, the Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) index, as representing the regional average of sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Indian Ocean. IOBW is closely associated with dengue epidemics for both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The ability of IOBW to predict dengue incidence likely arises as a result of its effect on local temperature anomalies through teleconnections. These findings indicate that the IOBW index can potentially enhance the lead time for dengue forecasts, leading to better-planned and more impactful outbreak responses.},

  abstract = {Objective To estimate the measles effective reproduction number (R) in Australia by modelling routinely collected notification data. Methods R was estimated for 2009--2011 by means of three methods, using data from Australia's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Method 1 estimated R as 1 - P, where P equals the proportion of cases that were imported, as determined from data on place of acquisition. The other methods estimated R by fitting a subcritical branching process that modelled the spread of an infection with a given R to the observed distributions of outbreak sizes (method 2) and generations of spread (method 3). Stata version 12 was used for method 2 and Matlab version R2012 was used for method 3. For all methods, calculation of 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) was performed using a normal approximation based on estimated standard errors. Findings During 2009--2011, 367 notifiable measles cases occurred in Australia (mean annual rate: 5.5 cases per million population). Data were 100\% complete for importation status but 77\% complete for outbreak reference number. R was estimated as {$<$} 1 for all years and data types, with values of 0.65 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.70) obtained by method 1, 0.64 (95\% CI: 0.56--0.72) by method 2 and 0.47 (95\% CI: 0.38--0.57) by method 3. Conclusion The fact that consistent estimates of R were obtained from all three methods enhances confidence in the validity of these methods for determining R.},

  abstract = {Background Dengue dynamics are driven by complex interactions between human-hosts, mosquito-vectors and viruses that are influenced by environmental and climatic factors. The objectives of this study were to analyze and model the relationships between climate, Aedes aegypti vectors and dengue outbreaks in Noumea (New Caledonia), and to provide an early warning system. Methodology/Principal Findings Epidemiological and meteorological data were analyzed from 1971 to 2010 in Noumea. Entomological surveillance indices were available from March 2000 to December 2009. During epidemic years, the distribution of dengue cases was highly seasonal. The epidemic peak (March--April) lagged the warmest temperature by 1--2 months and was in phase with maximum precipitations, relative humidity and entomological indices. Significant inter-annual correlations were observed between the risk of outbreak and summertime temperature, precipitations or relative humidity but not ENSO. Climate-based multivariate non-linear models were developed to estimate the yearly risk of dengue outbreak in Noumea. The best explicative meteorological variables were the number of days with maximal temperature exceeding 32{$^\circ$}C during January--February--March and the number of days with maximal relative humidity exceeding 95\% during January. The best predictive variables were the maximal temperature in December and maximal relative humidity during October--November--December of the previous year. For a probability of dengue outbreak above 65\% in leave-one-out cross validation, the explicative model predicted 94\% of the epidemic years and 79\% of the non epidemic years, and the predictive model 79\% and 65\%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The epidemic dynamics of dengue in Noumea were essentially driven by climate during the last forty years. Specific conditions based on maximal temperature and relative humidity thresholds were determinant in outbreaks occurrence. Their persistence was also crucial. An operational model that will enable health authorities to anticipate the outbreak risk was successfully developed. Similar models may be developed to improve dengue management in other countries.},

It depends on the duration of the infectious period, the probability of infecting a susceptible individual during one contact, and the number of new susceptible individuals contacted per unit of time. Therefore Ro may vary considerably for different infectious diseases but also for the same disease in different populations. The key threshold result of epidemic theory associates the outbreaks of epidemics and the persistence of endemic levels with basic reproduction numbers greater than one. Because the magnitude of R0 allows one to determine the amount of effort which is necessary either to prevent an epidemic or to eliminate an infection from a population, it is crucial to estimate Ro for a given disease in a particular population. The present paper gives a survey about the various estimation methods available.},

The magnitude and exceedingly abrupt rate of change of climate changes in the late Pleistocene ({$\sim$}20{$^\circ$}F/century) were vastly greater than any climate changes that have occurred in recent centuries. Ice-core oxygen isotope and paleo-temperature data clearly show remarkable swings in climate over the past 100,000years. In just the past 500years, Greenland warming/cooling temperatures fluctuated back and forth about 40 times, with changes every 25--30years (27years on average). At least three warming events in the past 25,000years were 20--24 times the magnitude of warming over the past century and four were 6--9 times the magnitude of warming over the past century. The magnitude of the only modern warming that might possibly have been caused by CO2 (1978--98) is insignificant compared to the earlier periods of warming. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) shows excellent correlation with climate changes during the past century---two periods of global warming and three periods of global cooling exactly match switches in PDO. In 2000, I projected these cyclic patterns into the future and predicted 25--30years of global cooling, and over the past 15years, the climate has cooled slightly. As we enter a Solar Minimum strongly resembling the Dalton Minimum when strong global cooling occurred, we can expect further cooling.},

Temperature along with other environmental factors at breeding and resting locations play a role in the organismal development and abundance of mosquitoes. Accurate analysis of mosquito population dynamics requires information on microclimatic conditions at breeding and resting locations. In this study, we develop a regression model to characterize microclimatic temperature based on ambient environmental conditions. Data were collected by placing sensor loggers at resting and breeding locations such as storm drains across Houston, TX. Corresponding weather data was obtained from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. Features extracted from these data sources along with contextual information on location were used to develop a Generalized Linear Model for predicting microclimate temperatures. We also analyzed mosquito population dynamics for Aedes albopictus under ambient and microclimatic conditions using system dynamic (SD) modelling to demonstrate the need for accurate microclimatic temperatures in population models. The microclimate prediction model had an R2 value of\,{\textasciitilde}\,95\% and average prediction error of\,{\textasciitilde}\,1.5~{$^\circ$}C indicating that microclimate temperatures can be reliably estimated from the ambient environmental conditions. SD model analysis indicates that some microclimates in Texas could result in larger populations of juvenile and adult Aedes albopictus mosquitoes surviving the winter without requiring dormancy.},

  abstract = {A station observation-based global land monthly mean surface air temperature dataset at 0.5 {\texttimes} 0.5 latitude-longitude resolution for the period from 1948 to the present was developed recently at the Climate Prediction Center, National Centers for Environmental Prediction. This data set is different from some existing surface air temperature data sets in: (1) using a combination of two large individual data sets of station observations collected from the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCN + CAMS), so it can be regularly updated in near real time with plenty of stations and (2) some unique interpolation methods, such as the anomaly interpolation approach with spatially-temporally varying temperature lapse rates derived from the observation-based Reanalysis for topographic adjustment. When compared with several existing observation-based land surface air temperature data sets, the preliminary results show that the quality of this new GHCN + CAMS land surface air temperature analysis is reasonably good and the new data set can capture most common temporal-spatial features in the observed climatology and anomaly fields over both regional and global domains. The study also reveals that there are clear biases between the observed surface air temperature and the existing Reanalysis data sets, and they vary in space and seasons. Therefore the Reanalysis 2 m temperature data sets may not be suitable for model forcing and validation. The GHCN + CAMS data set will be mainly used as one of land surface meteorological forcing inputs to derive other land surface variables, such as soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, snow accumulation and snow melt, etc. As a byproduct, this monthly mean surface air temperature data set can also be applied to monitor surface air temperature variations over global land routinely or to verify the performance of model simulation and prediction.},

Paradoxically, these large-scale indices can seem to be better predictors of ecological processes than local climate5,6,7,8. Using detailed data from a population of Soay sheep9,10, we show that high rainfall, high winds or low temperatures at any time during a 3-month period can cause mortality either immediately or lagged by a few days. Most measures of local climate used by ecologists fail to capture such complex associations between weather and ecological process, and this may help to explain why large-scale, seasonal indices of climate spanning several months can outperform local climatic factors. Furthermore, we show why an understanding of the mechanism by which climate influences population ecology is important. Through simulation we demonstrate that the timing of bad weather within a period of mortality can have an important modifying influence on intraspecific competition for food, revealing an interaction between climate and density dependence11 that the use of large-scale climatic indices or inappropriate local weather variables might obscure.},

The term ``loess'' is an acronym for ``local regression'' and the entire procedure is a fairly direct generalization of traditional least-squares methods for data analysis. Loess is nonparametric in the sense that the fitting technique does not require an a priori specification of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Although it is used most frequently as a scatterplot smoother, loess can be generalized very easily to multivariate data; there are also inferential procedures for confidence intervals and other statistical tests. For all of these reasons, loess is a useful tool for data exploration and analysis in the social sciences. And, loess should be particularly helpful in the field of elections and voting behavior because theories often lead to expectations of nonlinear empirical relationships even though prior substantive considerations provide very little guidance about precise functional forms.},

Knowledge of the contemporary distribution of their shared vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus remains incomplete and is complicated by an ongoing range expansion fuelled by increased global trade and travel. Mapping the global distribution of these vectors and the geographical determinants of their ranges is essential for public health planning. Here we compile the largest contemporary database for both species and pair it with relevant environmental variables predicting their global distribution. We show Aedes distributions to be the widest ever recorded; now extensive in all continents, including North America and Europe. These maps will help define the spatial limits of current autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses. It is only with this kind of rigorous entomological baseline that we can hope to project future health impacts of these viruses.},

  abstract = {Background: Dengue fever, transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes, poses a significant public health challenge in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue surveillance involves monitoring the incidence, distribution, and trends of infections through systematic data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. It supports public health decision-making, guiding interventions like vector control, vaccination campaigns, and public education. Objective: Herein, we report the development of a surveillance system already in use to support public health managers against dengue transmission in Foz do Igua{\c c}u, a dengue endemic Brazilian city located in the Triple Border with Argentina and Paraguay. Methods: We present data encompassing the fieldwork organization of more than 100 health agents, gathering epidemiological and entomological data from November 2022 to April 2024, totalizing 18 months of data collection. Results: By registering health agents, we were able to provide support for those facing issues to fill their daily milestone of inspecting 16 traps per working day. We filtered dengue transmission in the city by patients age, gender, and reporting units, as well as according to dengue virus (DENV) serotype. The entomological indices presented strong seasonal pattern, as expected. Several long-time established routines in Foz do Igua{\c c}u have been directly impacted by the adoption of VITEC. Conclusions: The implementation of VITEC has enabled more efficient and accurate diagnostics of local transmission risk, leading to a better understanding of operational activity patterns and risks. Lately, local public health managers can easily identify hotspots of dengue transmission and optimize interventions toward those highly sensitive areas.},

  abstract = {Flood-related fatalities and impacts on society surpass those from all other natural disasters globally. While the inclusion of large-scale climate drivers in streamflow (or high-flow) prediction has been widely studied, an explicit link to global-scale long-lead prediction is lacking, which can lead to an improved understanding of potential flood propensity. Here we attribute seasonal peak-flow to large-scale climate patterns, including the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), using streamflow station observations and simulations from PCR-GLOBWB, a global-scale hydrologic model. Statistically significantly correlated climate patterns and streamflow autocorrelation are subsequently applied as predictors to build a global-scale season-ahead prediction model, with prediction performance evaluated by the mean squared error skill score (MSESS) and the categorical Gerrity skill score (GSS). Globally, fair-to-good prediction skill (20\% {$\leq$} MSESS and 0.2 {$\leq$} GSS) is evident for a number of locations (28\% of stations and 29\% of land area), most notably in data-poor regions (e.g., West and Central Africa). The persistence of such relevant climate patterns can improve understanding of the propensity for floods at the seasonal scale. The prediction approach developed here lays the groundwork for further improving local-scale seasonal peak-flow prediction by identifying relevant global-scale climate patterns. This is especially attractive for regions with limited observations and or little capacity to develop flood early warning systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus are the most common viruses associated with acute lower respiratory infections in young children ({$<$}5 years) and older people ({$\geq$}65 years). A global report of the monthly activity of these viruses is needed to inform public health strategies and programmes for their control. METHODS: In this systematic analysis, we compiled data from a systematic literature review of studies published between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2017; online datasets; and unpublished research data. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported laboratory-confirmed incidence data of human infection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, or metapneumovirus, or a combination of these, for at least 12 consecutive months (or 52 weeks equivalent); stable testing practice throughout all years reported; virus results among residents in well-defined geographical locations; and aggregated virus results at least on a monthly basis. Data were extracted through a three-stage process, from which we calculated monthly annual average percentage (AAP) as the relative strength of virus activity. We defined duration of epidemics as the minimum number of months to account for 75\% of annual positive samples, with each component month defined as an epidemic month. Furthermore, we modelled monthly AAP of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus using site-specific temperature and relative humidity for the prediction of local average epidemic months. We also predicted global epidemic months of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus on a 5{$^\circ$} by 5{$^\circ$} grid. The systematic review in this study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018091628. FINDINGS: We initally identified 37\hphantom{,}335 eligible studies. Of 21\hphantom{,}065 studies remaining after exclusion of duplicates, 1081 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 185 were identified as eligible. We included 246 sites for influenza virus, 183 sites for respiratory syncytial virus, 83 sites for parainfluenza virus, and 65 sites for metapneumovirus. Influenza virus had clear seasonal epidemics in winter months in most temperate sites but timing of epidemics was more variable and less seasonal with decreasing distance from the equator. Unlike influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus had clear seasonal epidemics in both temperate and tropical regions, starting in late summer months in the tropics of each hemisphere, reaching most temperate sites in winter months. In most temperate sites, influenza virus epidemics occurred later than respiratory syncytial virus (by 0{$\cdot$}3 months [95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}3 to 0{$\cdot$}9]) while no clear temporal order was observed in the tropics. Parainfluenza virus epidemics were found mostly in spring and early summer months in each hemisphere. Metapneumovirus epidemics occurred in late winter and spring in most temperate sites but the timing of epidemics was more diverse in the tropics. Influenza virus epidemics had shorter duration (3{$\cdot$}8 months [3{$\cdot$}6 to 4{$\cdot$}0]) in temperate sites and longer duration (5{$\cdot$}2 months [4{$\cdot$}9 to 5{$\cdot$}5]) in the tropics. Duration of epidemics was similar across all sites for respiratory syncytial virus (4{$\cdot$}6 months [4{$\cdot$}3 to 4{$\cdot$}8]), as it was for metapneumovirus (4{$\cdot$}8 months [4{$\cdot$}4 to 5{$\cdot$}1]). By comparison, parainfluenza virus had longer duration of epidemics (6{$\cdot$}3 months [6{$\cdot$}0 to 6{$\cdot$}7]). Our model had good predictability in the average epidemic months of influenza virus in temperate regions and respiratory syncytial virus in both temperate and tropical regions. Through leave-one-out cross validation, the overall prediction error in the onset of epidemics was within 1 month (influenza virus -0{$\cdot$}2 months [-0{$\cdot$}6 to 0{$\cdot$}1]; respiratory syncytial virus 0{$\cdot$}1 months [-0{$\cdot$}2 to 0{$\cdot$}4]). INTERPRETATION: This study is the first to provide global representations of month-by-month activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus. Our model is helpful in predicting the local onset month of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics. The seasonality information has important implications for health services planning, the timing of respiratory syncytial virus passive prophylaxis, and the strategy of influenza virus and future respiratory syncytial virus vaccination.

  abstract = {Given two time series, can one faithfully tell, in a rigorous and quantitative way, the cause and effect between them? Based on a recently rigorized physical notion, namely, information flow, we solve an inverse problem and give this important and challenging question, which is of interest in a wide variety of disciplines, a positive answer. Here causality is measured by the time rate of information flowing from one series to the other. The resulting formula is tight in form, involving only commonly used statistics, namely, sample covariances; an immediate corollary is that causation implies correlation, but correlation does not imply causation. It has been validated with touchstone linear and nonlinear series, purportedly generated with one-way causality that evades the traditional approaches. It has also been applied successfully to the investigation of real-world problems; an example presented here is the cause-and-effect relation between the two climate modes, El Ni{\~n}o and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which have been linked to hazards in far-flung regions of the globe. In general, the two modes are mutually causal, but the causality is asymmetric: El Ni{\~n}o tends to stabilize IOD, while IOD functions to make El Ni{\~n}o more uncertain. To El Ni{\~n}o, the information flowing from IOD manifests itself as a propagation of uncertainty from the Indian Ocean.},

  abstract = {Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that occurs mainly in the tropics and subtropics but has a high potential to spread to new areas. Dengue infections are climate sensitive, so it is important to better understand how changing climate factors affect the potential for geographic spread and future dengue epidemics. Vectorial capacity (VC) describes a vector's propensity to transmit dengue taking into account human, virus, and vector interactions. VC is highly temperature dependent, but most dengue models only take mean temperature values into account. Recent evidence shows that diurnal temperature range (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behavior of the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we used relative VC to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP) based on the temperature and DTR dependence of the parameters of A. aegypti. We found a strong temperature dependence of DEP; it peaked at a mean temperature of 29.3{$^\circ$}C when DTR was 0{$^\circ$}C and at 20{$^\circ$}C when DTR was 20{$^\circ$}C. Increasing average temperatures up to 29{$^\circ$}C led to an increased DEP, but temperatures above 29{$^\circ$}C reduced DEP. In tropical areas where the mean temperatures are close to 29{$^\circ$}C, a small DTR increased DEP while a large DTR reduced it. In cold to temperate or extremely hot climates where the mean temperatures are far from 29{$^\circ$}C, increasing DTR was associated with increasing DEP. Incorporating these findings using historical and predicted temperature and DTR over a two hundred year period (1901--2099), we found an increasing trend of global DEP in temperate regions. Small increases in DEP were observed over the last 100 years and large increases are expected by the end of this century in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions using climate change projections. These findings illustrate the importance of including DTR when mapping DEP based on VC.},

  abstract = {Background Over the last 5 years (2013--2017), the Caribbean region has faced an unprecedented crisis of co-occurring epidemics of febrile illness due to arboviruses transmitted by the Aedes sp. mosquito (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). Since 2013, the Caribbean island of Barbados has experienced 3 dengue outbreaks, 1 chikungunya outbreak, and 1 Zika fever outbreak. Prior studies have demonstrated that climate variability influences arbovirus transmission and vector population dynamics in the region, indicating the potential to develop public health interventions using climate information. The aim of this study is to quantify the nonlinear and delayed effects of climate indicators, such as drought and extreme rainfall, on dengue risk in Barbados from 1999 to 2016. Methods and findings Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) coupled with a hierarchal mixed-model framework were used to understand the exposure--lag--response association between dengue relative risk and key climate indicators, including the standardised precipitation index (SPI) and minimum temperature (Tmin). The model parameters were estimated in a Bayesian framework to produce probabilistic predictions of exceeding an island-specific outbreak threshold. The ability of the model to successfully detect outbreaks was assessed and compared to a baseline model, representative of standard dengue surveillance practice. Drought conditions were found to positively influence dengue relative risk at long lead times of up to 5 months, while excess rainfall increased the risk at shorter lead times between 1 and 2 months. The SPI averaged over a 6-month period (SPI-6), designed to monitor drought and extreme rainfall, better explained variations in dengue risk than monthly precipitation data measured in millimetres. Tmin was found to be a better predictor than mean and maximum temperature. Furthermore, including bidimensional exposure--lag--response functions of these indicators---rather than linear effects for individual lags---more appropriately described the climate--disease associations than traditional modelling approaches. In prediction mode, the model was successfully able to distinguish outbreaks from nonoutbreaks for most years, with an overall proportion of correct predictions (hits and correct rejections) of 86\% (81\%:91\%) compared with 64\% (58\%:71\%) for the baseline model. The ability of the model to predict dengue outbreaks in recent years was complicated by the lack of data on the emergence of new arboviruses, including chikungunya and Zika. Conclusion We present a modelling approach to infer the risk of dengue outbreaks given the cumulative effect of climate variations in the months leading up to an outbreak. By combining the dengue prediction model with climate indicators, which are routinely monitored and forecasted by the Regional Climate Centre (RCC) at the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), probabilistic dengue outlooks could be included in the Caribbean Health-Climatic Bulletin, issued on a quarterly basis to provide climate-smart decision-making guidance for Caribbean health practitioners. This flexible modelling approach could be extended to model the risk of dengue and other arboviruses in the Caribbean region.},

  abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the tropical Atlantic Ocean strongly impacts the climate on the surrounding continents. On interannual time scales, highest SST variability occurs in the eastern equatorial region and off the coast of southwestern Africa. The pattern of SST variability resembles the Pacific El Ni{\~n}o, but features notable differences, and has been discussed in the context of various climate modes, that is, reoccurring patterns resulting from particular interactions in the climate system. Here, we attempt to reconcile those different definitions, concluding that almost all of them are essentially describing the same mode that we refer to as the ``Atlantic Ni{\~n}o.'' We give an overview of the mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie this mode, and we discuss its interaction with other climate modes within and outside the tropical Atlantic. The impact of Atlantic Ni{\~n}o-related SST variability on rainfall, in particular over the Gulf of Guinea and north eastern South America is also described. An important aspect we highlight is that the Atlantic Ni{\~n}o and its teleconnections are not stationary, but subject to multidecadal modulations. Simulating the Atlantic Ni{\~n}o proves a challenge for state-of-the-art climate models, and this may be partly due to the large mean state biases in the region. Potential reasons for these model biases and implications for seasonal prediction are discussed.

This policy approach is grounded in the knowledge that approximately 70 percent of emerging diseases in humans originate from other species, and that this species crossover is precipitated by stresses to environmental systems such as habitat change and biodiversity loss. Remote sensing tools apply well to this approach due to the multitude of variables that can be measured across borders in real-time. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities of using satellite remote sensing to monitor biodiversity loss in real time, with a goal of predictive surveillance for emerging disease events. Key findings include that (1) certain emerging disease events are preceded by biodiversity changes that can be observed from space; (2) refining quantitative assessments of biodiversity loss is a critical next step; and (3) biodiversity loss as observed from space merits inclusion in emerging disease surveillance programs as a complement to in situ and epidemiological surveillance data.},

We use mechanistic transmission models to derive predictions for how the probability and magnitude of transmission for Zika, chikungunya, and dengue change with mean temperature, and we show that these predictions are well matched by human case data. Across all three viruses, models and human case data both show that transmission occurs between 18--34{$^\circ$}C with maximal transmission occurring in a range from 26--29{$^\circ$}C. Controlling for population size and two socioeconomic factors, temperature-dependent transmission based on our mechanistic model is an important predictor of human transmission occurrence and incidence. Risk maps indicate that tropical and subtropical regions are suitable for extended seasonal or year-round transmission, but transmission in temperate areas is limited to at most three months per year even if vectors are present. Such brief transmission windows limit the likelihood of major epidemics following disease introduction in temperate zones.},

The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens, and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15 different mosquito species -- including globally important diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika -- synthesised from previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23--29ºC and declining to zero below 9--23ºC and above 32--38ºC. Different traits restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus had lower thermal optima (25--26ºC) while dengue and Zika viruses had the highest (29ºC) thermal optima. We expect warming to increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate adaptation and migration.},

Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.},

We found an expansion in climate suitability in North America, East Asia and the Mediterranean basin, where with few exceptions, endemicity is not yet established. Globally, we estimated that the population in areas with high climate suitability has grown by approximately 2.5 billion. In the Global South, this increase was largely driven by population growth in areas with historically favorable climate suitability, while in the Global North this increase predominantly occurred in previously unfavorable areas with limited population growth.},

Despite this trend, surveillance for this vector-borne viral disease remains largely passive in most Southeast Asian countries, without adequate laboratory support. We review here the factors that may have contributed to the changing epidemiology of dengue in Southeast Asia as well as challenges of disease prevention. We also discuss a regional approach to active dengue virus surveillance, focusing on urban areas where the viruses are maintained, which may be a solution to limited financial resources since most of the countries in the region have developing economies. A regional approach would also result in a greater likelihood of success in disease prevention since the large volume of human travel is a major factor contributing to the geographical spread of dengue viruses.},

  abstract = {BackgroundImmature stages of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae experience high mortality, but its cause is poorly understood. Here we study the impact of rainfall, one of the abiotic factors to which the immatures are frequently exposed, on their mortality.Methodology/Principal FindingsWe show that rainfall significantly affected larval mosquitoes by flushing them out of their aquatic habitat and killing them. Outdoor experiments under natural conditions in Kenya revealed that the additional nightly loss of larvae caused by rainfall was on average 17.5\% for the youngest (L1) larvae and 4.8\% for the oldest (L4) larvae; an additional 10.5\% (increase from 0.9 to 11.4\%) of the L1 larvae and 3.3\% (from 0.1 to 3.4\%) of the L4 larvae were flushed away and larval mortality increased by 6.9\% (from 4.6 to 11.5\%) and 1.5\% (from 4.1 to 5.6\%) for L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, compared to nights without rain. On rainy nights, 1.3\% and 0.7\% of L1 and L4 larvae, respectively, were lost due to ejection from the breeding site.Conclusions/SignificanceThis study demonstrates that immature populations of malaria mosquitoes suffer high losses during rainfall events. As these populations are likely to experience several rain showers during their lifespan, rainfall will have a profound effect on the productivity of mosquito breeding sites and, as a result, on the transmission of malaria. These findings are discussed in the light of malaria risk and changing rainfall patterns in response to climate change.},

Due to the prevalence of extreme events in the past two decades, this complexity is growing in the 21st century. In this study, the global spatiotemporal trend of SM and its possible influencing factors were investigated by using the satellite-based ESA CCI SM from 2000-2021. The results reveal global SM generally declines at a rate of -1{\texttimes}10-4 m3m-3yr-1, dominated by a drying trend in the southern hemisphere. From a global perspective, the driving force of precipitation and vegetation on SM fluctuation is stronger than that of temperature. Different environmental variables (e.g., land cover, soil texture, and terrain) have different regulatory effects on SM changes. In contrast to other types, there are general wetting trends of SM in croplands, savannas, forests, loam soils, and high elevations ({$>$} 1000 m). The response of SM to temperature and vegetation is greatly limited under barren and forests, respectively. The impact of temperature on SM is enhanced with increasing clay content or decreasing sand content. The high positive correlation between precipitation and SM is rarely influenced by environmental factors compared to temperature and vegetation.},

  abstract = {Southern Europe is increasingly at risk for dengue emergence, given the seasonal presence of relevant mosquito vectors and suitable climatic conditions. For example, Aedes mosquitoes, the main vector for both dengue and chikungunya, are abundant in Italy, and Italy experienced the first ever outbreak of chikungunya in Europe in 2007. We set out to estimate the extent of dengue virus importations into Italy via air travelers.We attempted to quantify the number of dengue virus importations based on modeling of published estimates on dengue incidence in the countries of disembarkation and analysis of data on comprehensive air travel from these countries into Italy's largest international airport in Rome.From 2005 to 2012, more than 7.3\,million air passengers departing from 100 dengue-endemic countries arrived in Rome. Our Importation Model, which included air traveler volume, estimated the incidence of dengue infections in the countries of disembarkation, and the probability of infection coinciding with travel accounted for an average of 2,320 (1,621--3,255) imported dengue virus infections per year, of which 572 (381--858) were ``apparent'' dengue infections and 1,747 (1,240--2,397) ``inapparent.''Between 2005 and 2012, we found an increasing trend of dengue virus infections imported into Rome via air travel, which may pose a potential threat for future emergence of dengue in Italy, given that the reoccurring pattern of peak importations corresponds seasonally with periods of relevant mosquito vector activity. The observed increasing annual trends of dengue importation and the consistent peaks in late summer underpin the urgency in determining the threshold levels for the vector and infected human populations that could facilitate novel autochthonous transmission of dengue in Europe.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diseases transmitted to humans by vectors account for 17\% of all infectious diseases and remain significant public health problems. Through the years, great strides have been taken towards combatting vector-borne diseases (VBDs), most notably through large scale and coordinated control programmes, which have contributed to the decline of the global mortality attributed to VBDs. However, with environmental changes, including climate change, the impact on VBDs is anticipated to be significant, in terms of VBD-related hazards, vulnerabilities and exposure. While there is growing awareness on the vulnerability of the African continent to VBDs in the context of climate change, there is still a paucity of research being undertaken in this area, and impeding the formulation of evidence-based health policy change. MAIN BODY: One way in which the gap in knowledge and evidence can be filled is for donor institutions to support research in this area. The collaboration between the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and the International Centre for Research and Development (IDRC) builds on more than 10~years of partnership in research capacity-building in the field of tropical diseases. From this partnership was born yet another research initiative on VBDs and the impact of climate change in the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa. This paper lists the projects supported under this research initiative and provides a brief on some of the policy and good practice recommendations emerging from the ongoing implementation of the research projects. CONCLUSION: Data generated from the research initiative are expected to be uptaken by stakeholders (including communities, policy makers, public health practitioners and other relevant partners) to contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of social, environmental and climate change on VBDs(i.e. the nature of the hazard, vulnerabilities, exposure), and improve the ability of African countries to adapt to and reduce the effects of these changes in ways that benefit their most vulnerable populations.},

Two independent reviewers screened the title/abstracts and full texts of the studies. Two reviewers also performed data extraction and quality assessment. From 5051 identified studies, 11 were included in the review. Although the results were inconsistent, most studies imply that a decrease in temperature and humidity contributes to an increase in mortality.

In this regard, it is imperative to understand the regional level manifestations of climate change for the more densely populated and less-explored, fast-developing regions of the Global South. There remains a great amount of uncertainty for these regions due to limited spatial and temporal spread of climate data. Based on the analysis of long term climate records, the majority of the Global south is extremely vulnerable and under-prepared for the impending impacts of climate change. Some of the specific impacts include decreasing trends in precipitation accompanied by increasing trends in temperatures and extreme weather events. Specifically, some areas, such as small low-lying islands in the Pacific, are more vulnerable to climate change and the impacts resulting from sea level rise. Furthermore, the concentration of population along the coast with limited access to resources and poor infrastructure makes this region more vulnerable. These impacts will be disproportionately burdened on women and girls, due to high gender inequality and their high representation below the poverty line.},

A role for absolute humidity in the transmission of pandemic influenza, such as 2009 A/H1N1, has yet to be demonstrated and, indeed, outbreaks of pandemic influenza during more humid spring, summer, and autumn months might appear to constitute evidence against an effect of humidity. However, here the authors show that variations of the basic and effective reproductive numbers for influenza, caused by seasonal changes in absolute humidity, are consistent with the general timing of pandemic influenza outbreaks observed for 2009 A/H1N1 in temperate regions, as well as wintertime transmission of epidemic influenza. Indeed, absolute humidity conditions correctly identify the region of the United States vulnerable to a third, wintertime wave of pandemic influenza. These findings suggest that the timing of pandemic influenza outbreaks is controlled by a combination of absolute humidity conditions, levels of susceptibility, and changes in population-mixing and contact rates.},

  abstract = {Climate change has emerged across many regions. Some observed regional climate changes, such as amplified Arctic warming and land-sea warming contrasts have been predicted by climate models. However, many other observed regional changes, such as changes in tropical sea surface temperature and monsoon rainfall are not well simulated by climate model ensembles even when taking into account natural internal variability and structural uncertainties in the response of models to anthropogenic radiative forcing. This suggests climate model predictions may not fully reflect what our future will look like. The discrepancies between models and observations are not well understood due to several real and apparent puzzles and limitations such as the "signal-to-noise paradox" and real-world record-shattering extremes falling outside of the possible range predicted by models. Addressing these discrepancies, puzzles and limitations is essential, because understanding and reliably predicting regional climate change is necessary in order to communicate effectively about the underlying drivers of change, provide reliable information to stakeholders, enable societies to adapt, and increase resilience and reduce vulnerability. The challenges of achieving this are greater in the Global South, especially because of the lack of observational data over long time periods and a lack of scientific focus on Global South climate change. To address discrepancies between observations and models, it is important to prioritize resources for understanding regional climate predictions and analyzing where and why models and observations disagree via testing hypotheses of drivers of biases using observations and models. Gaps in understanding can be discovered and filled by exploiting new tools, such as artificial intelligence/machine learning, high-resolution models, new modeling experiments in the model hierarchy, better quantification of forcing, and new observations. Conscious efforts are needed towards creating opportunities that allow regional experts, particularly those from the Global South, to take the lead in regional climate research. This includes co-learning in technical aspects of analyzing simulations and in the physics and dynamics of regional climate change. Finally, improved methods of regional climate communication are needed, which account for the underlying uncertainties, in order to provide reliable and actionable information to stakeholders and the media.},

This paper synthesizes existing studies to calculate the economic burden of dengue illness in the Americas from a societal perspective. Major data sources include national case reporting data from 2000 to 2007, prospective cost of illness studies, and analyses quantifying underreporting in national routine surveillance systems. Dengue illness in the Americas was estimated to cost \$2.1 billion per year on average (in 2010 US dollars), with a range of \$1--4 billion in sensitivity analyses and substantial year to year variation. The results highlight the substantial economic burden from dengue in the Americas. The burden for dengue exceeds that from other viral illnesses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) or rotavirus. Because this study does not include some components (e.g., vector control), it may still underestimate total economic consequences of dengue.},

Data on the number of dengue cases and weather variables including rainfall, rainy day, mean temperature, min temperature, max temperature, relative humidity, and air pressure for the period from January 2015 to December 2019 were obtained from the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health and the Meteorological Department of Southern Thailand, respectively. Spearman rank correlation test was performed at lags from zero to two months and the predictive modeling used time series Poisson regression analysis. The distribution of dengue cases showed that in Pattani and Yala provinces the most dengue cases occurred in June. Narathiwat province had the most dengue cases occurring in August. The air pressure, relative humidity, rainfall, rainy day, and min temperature are the main predictors in Pattani province, while air pressure, rainy day, and max/mean temperature seem to play important roles in the number of dengue cases in Yala and Narathiwat provinces. The goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the model fits the data reasonably well. The results provide scientific information for creating effective dengue control programs in the community, and the predictive model can support decision making in public health organizations and for management of the environmental risk area.},

  abstract = {In Singapore, the frequency and magnitude of dengue epidemics have increased significantly over the past 40 years. It is important to understand the main drivers for the rapid increase in dengue incidence. We studied the relative contributions of putative drivers for the rise of dengue in Singapore: population growth, climate parameters and international air passenger arrivals from dengue endemic countries, for the time period of 1974 until 2011. We used multivariable Poisson regression models with the following predictors: Annual Population Size; Aedes Premises Index; Mean Annual Temperature; Minimum and Maximum Temperature Recorded in each year; Annual Precipitation and Annual Number of Air Passengers arriving from dengue-endemic South-East Asia to Singapore. The relative risk (RR) of the increase in dengue incidence due to population growth over the study period was 42.7, while the climate variables (mean and minimum temperature) together explained an RR of 7.1 (RR defined as risk at the end of the time period relative to the beginning and goodness of fit associated with the model leading to these estimates assessed by pseudo-R2 equal to 0.83). Estimating the extent of the contribution of these individual factors on the increasing dengue incidence, we found that population growth contributed to 86\% while the residual 14\% was explained by increase in temperature. We found no correlation with incoming air passenger arrivals into Singapore from dengue endemic countries. Our findings have significant implications for predicting future trends of the dengue epidemics given the rapid urbanization with population growth in many dengue endemic countries. It is time for policy-makers and the scientific community alike to pay more attention to the negative impact of urbanization and urban climate on diseases such as dengue.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Climate-based disease forecasting has been proposed as a potential tool in climate change adaptation for the health sector. Here we explore the relevance of climate data, drivers and predictions for vector-borne disease control efforts in Africa. METHODS: Using data from a number of sources we explore rainfall and temperature across the African continent, from seasonality to variability at annual, multi-decadal and timescales consistent with climate change. We give particular attention to three regions defined as WHO-TDR study zones in Western, Eastern and Southern Africa. Our analyses include 1) time scale decomposition to establish the relative importance of year-to-year, decadal and long term trends in rainfall and temperature; 2) the impact of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on rainfall and temperature at the Pan African scale; 3) the impact of ENSO on the climate of Tanzania using high resolution climate products and 4) the potential predictability of the climate in different regions and seasons using Generalized Relative Operating Characteristics. We use these analyses to review the relevance of climate forecasts for applications in vector borne disease control across the continent. RESULTS: Timescale decomposition revealed long term warming in all three regions of Africa - at the level of 0.1-0.3~{$^\circ$}C per decade. Decadal variations in rainfall were apparent in all regions and particularly pronounced in the Sahel and during the East African long rains (March-May). Year-to-year variability in both rainfall and temperature, in part associated with ENSO, were the dominant signal for climate variations on any timescale. Observed climate data and seasonal climate forecasts were identified as the most relevant sources of climate information for use in early warning systems for vector-borne diseases but the latter varied in skill by region and season. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptation to the vector-borne disease risks of climate variability and change is a priority for government and civil society in African countries. Understanding rainfall and temperature variations and trends at multiple timescales and their potential predictability is a necessary first step in the incorporation of relevant climate information into vector-borne disease control decision-making.},

Through the years it has been used as a scientific and teaching tool for prescribing the general world pattern of climates. Here for the first time an evaluation of the system is performed by employing coextensive temperature and precipitation data over the N. Hemisphere for the last 140 years. First the global pattern of climate type sensitivity is obtained. From this pattern it is discovered that several climate types exhibit a rather strong variability. Since all climate types depend on temperature we then tested whether or not the above variability is due to the fact that over the last 140 years the global climate system exhibits a well documented positive temperature trend known as global warming. We found that the K{\"o}ppen system is rather insensitive to the observed global warming and concluded that overall the system performs rather poorly over Europe and Asia whereas it appears adequate over N. America and N. Africa.},

  abstract = {The recent emergence of dengue viruses into new susceptible human populations throughout Asia and the Middle East, driven in part by human travel on both local and global scales, represents a significant global health risk, particularly in areas with changing climatic suitability for the mosquito vector. In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from {$\sim$}40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.},

We present the global, regional and national burden of dengue from 1990 to 2019 based on the findings from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019). METHODS: Based upon GBD 2019 dengue data on age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate, this study estimates and presents annual percentage change (EAPC) to quantify trends over time to assess potential correlates of increased dengue activity, such as global travel and warming. RESULTS: Globally from 1990 to 2019, dengue incident cases, deaths and DALYs gradually increased. Those under 5 years of age, once accounting for the largest portion of deaths and DALYs in 1990, were eclipsed by those who were 15-49~years old in 2019. Age standardized incidence [ASIR: EAPC: 3.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.90-3.43], death (ASDR: EAPC: 5.42, 95\% CI: 2.64-8.28) and DALY rates (EAPC: 2.31, 95\% CI: 2.00-2.62) accelerated most among high-middle and high sociodemographic index (SDI) regions. South-East Asia and South Asia had most of the dengue incident cases, deaths and DALYs, but East Asia had the fastest rise in ASIR (EAPC: 4.57, 95\% CI: 4.31, 4.82), while Tropical Latin America led in ASDR (EAPC: 11.32, 95\% CI: 9.11, 13.58) and age-standardized DALYs rate (EAPC: 4.13, 95\% CI: 2.98, 5.29). SDI showed consistent bell-shaped relationship with ASIR, ASDR and age-standardized DALYs rate. Global land-ocean temperature index and air passenger travel metrics were found to be remarkably positively correlated with dengue burden. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of dengue has become heavier from 1990 to 2019, amidst the three decades of urbanization, warming climates and increased human mobility in much of the world. South-East Asia and South Asia remain as regions of concern, especially in conjunction with the Americas' swift rise in dengue burden.},
